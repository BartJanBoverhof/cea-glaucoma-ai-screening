Preliminaries
=============

-   Install [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
-   Install `devtools` to install `darthpack` as a package and modify it to generate your own package

``` r
# Install release version from CRAN
install.packages("devtools")

# Or install development version from GitHub
# devtools::install_github("r-lib/devtools")
```

[`darthpack`](https://github.com/DARTH-git/darthpack) is an R package that showcases the [Decision Analysis in R for Technologies in Health (DARTH)](https://darthworkgroup.com) coding framework to construct model-based cost-effectiveness analysis in R. The main website of `darthpack` can be [found here](https://darth-git.github.io/darthpack/).
